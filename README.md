# ERCX-NFT
ERC-X - An Interoperable, Dynamic, and Programmable NFT Standard

Abstract: The ERC-X standard aims to enhance the current NFT ecosystem by introducing a set of innovative features that promote cross-platform compatibility, enable dynamic and programmable NFT properties, and support creator royalties. Building on existing standards like ERC-721 and ERC-1155, ERC-X seeks to revolutionize the NFT landscape by unlocking new use cases and fostering a more interconnected and versatile digital asset ecosystem.

Motivation: Current NFT standards, while pioneering, have limitations that hinder the full potential of non-fungible tokens. By introducing cross-chain compatibility, dynamic properties, composability, integrated royalties, programmability, and enhanced metadata and storage, the ERC-X standard aims to address these limitations and push the boundaries of NFT utility and versatility.

Specification:

*Cross-Chain Compatibility: ERC-X NFTs can be transferred and used across multiple blockchain ecosystems, enabling seamless asset movement and promoting interconnectedness between networks.

*Dynamic Properties: Unlike static NFTs, ERC-X tokens support attributes that change over time or based on specific conditions or events, enabling the creation of evolving, adaptive, and interactive digital assets.

*Composable NFTs: The standard supports NFTs composed of other NFTs or tokens, creating complex, hierarchical structures and enabling the creation of customizable and modular digital assets.

*Integrated Royalties: To promote fair value distribution, ERC-X includes built-in royalty mechanisms that ensure creators receive a percentage of secondary market sales.
Programmable NFTs: ERC-X incorporates smart contract functionality, enabling programmable NFTs with customizable logic and behaviors, facilitating the development of advanced applications and use cases.

*Enhanced Metadata and Storage: The standard provides an improved metadata structure and support for decentralized storage solutions, ensuring NFT metadata and associated content remain accessible and secure.


Conclusion: The ERC-X standard offers a comprehensive and innovative solution to address the limitations of existing NFT standards. By promoting interoperability, enabling dynamic and programmable properties, and supporting creator royalties, ERC-X has the potential to revolutionize the NFT space, unlocking new use cases and fostering a more vibrant and interconnected digital asset ecosystem.
